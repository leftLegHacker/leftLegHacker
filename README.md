- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @leftLegHacker, currently I'm a sophomore in Computer Science with an emphisis in Informmation Security.
My background includes years of hands-on experience in diagnostics, which Iâ€™ve applied to problem-solving in various technical environments.
Recently, I attended DEFCON, where I participated in the car hacking village, contributing my knowledge to restore communication within a CAN bus system.
This experience allowed me to integrate my understanding of system vulnerabilities with practical solutions. Iâ€™m excited to apply the critical thinking and
diagnostic skills Iâ€™ve developed from my automotive background to cybersecurity challenges across multiple industries.
